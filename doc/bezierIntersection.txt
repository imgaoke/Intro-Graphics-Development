Ordered list (HeapMin) sorted by T:
-----------------------------------
A. bezier patch:
  control points, minimax box (compatible with RayBoxIntersection())
  closest intersection with a ray T

B. actual intersection T (created by RayTriangleIntersection())
  interpolated normal vector (not yet?)
  coordinates of an intersection (not yet?)
  d  c
  a  b
  Two triangles: abc, acd

Algorithm:
----------
0. create the A. record for each patch,
  filter out patches not intersected by the ray..
  put all intersected patches into the list

1. while "list is not empty" do

2. fetch the first item of the list
   if this is the B. item, finalize it and return

3. else divide the patch into two halves (according the greatest coordinate variance)
   intersect both of them with the ray,
   insert relevant record[s] back into the list

4. if an A. record is too small (too flat, ..), convert it into a B. record

5. endwhile
